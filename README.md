**Software as a Service (SaaS) is a business model that provides customers with access to software applications and services over the internet on a subscription basis. In this model, instead of purchasing and installing software on their own computers or servers, users can access the software through a web browser or dedicated application. The SaaS model offers numerous benefits to both providers and customers. For providers, it eliminates the need to distribute physical copies of software or handle complex installation processes. They can deliver their applications instantly to a wide range of customers, regardless of their location. Additionally, SaaS providers can easily update and maintain their software, ensuring that users always have access to the latest features and improvements.**
